# Product Overview

Mukti (meaning "liberation" in Hindi) is a cognitive liberation platform that uses AI to enhance critical thinking rather than replace it.

## Core Philosophy

Instead of providing direct answers, Mukti employs the Socratic method to guide users through structured inquiry. The platform challenges users with thought-provoking questions, encourages self-discovery through iterative dialogue, and cultivates cognitive resilience.

## Key Principle

**Questions over answers.** Every feature should make users think harder, not less. The goal is to build mental agility and independence, not dependency on AI-generated solutions.

## Target Use Cases

- Coding problems (debugging, planning, optimization, design)
- Creative writing and ideation
- Personal productivity and learning
- Any domain requiring critical thinking and problem-solving

## Product Components

- **mukti-web**: Landing page and waitlist (Next.js)
- **mukti-api**: Backend API implementing the Thinking Workspace paradigm (NestJS)
- **mukti-mcp-server**: Model Context Protocol server for AI integrations

## Current Status

Early development phase. Core infrastructure is established, with Socratic methodology features in active development.
