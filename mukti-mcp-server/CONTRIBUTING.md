# Contributing to Mukti MCP Server

Welcome to the Mukti MCP Server project! We're excited that you're interested in contributing to our Socratic learning system. This guide will help you get started with contributing code, documentation, or other improvements.

## üéØ Project Overview

Mukti is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that implements Socratic questioning techniques to help users learn and solve problems through guided inquiry. Instead of providing direct answers, Mukti helps users discover solutions through thoughtful questions and exploration.

### Core Principles

- **Socratic Method**: Guide users to insights through questioning rather than direct answers
- **Adaptive Learning**: Personalize the experience based on user behavior and preferences
- **Educational Value**: Every interaction should promote learning and critical thinking
- **Accessibility**: Make powerful learning tools available to everyone

## üöÄ Getting Started

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Guidelines

### Code Style

We follow strict TypeScript and code quality standards:

**TypeScript Standards:**

- Use strict TypeScript configuration
- All functions must have proper type annotations
- No `any` types unless absolutely necessary
- Prefer interfaces over types for object shapes
- Use enums for constants with multiple values

**Code Formatting:**

- We use Prettier for code formatting
- Run `npm run format` before committing
- 2-space indentation
- Single quotes for strings
- Trailing commas in multiline structures

**Naming Conventions:**

- **Classes**: PascalCase (`SocraticEngine`)
- **Functions/Methods**: camelCase (`generateQuestions`)
- **Constants**: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (`QUERY_TYPE`)
- **Types/Interfaces**: PascalCase (`QueryType`, `SocraticResponse`)
- **Files**: kebab-case (`response-strategies.ts`)

### Architecture Patterns

**Core Classes:**

- `SocraticEngine`: Core questioning logic
- `ResponseStrategyFactory`: Context-aware response generation
- Keep classes focused on single responsibilities

**Type Safety:**

- Use the types defined in `types.ts`
- Create new types for new features
- Export types that might be used by external code
- Document complex types with JSDoc comments

**Error Handling:**

- Use proper error types and messages
- Log errors appropriately for debugging
- Provide graceful fallbacks where possible
- Don't expose internal errors to users

## üß™ Testing Requirements

### Test Coverage

- All new features must include tests
- Aim for >80% test coverage
- Test both happy paths and error cases
- Include integration tests for MCP handlers

### Test Types

**Unit Tests:**

```typescript
// Example unit test structure
describe("SocraticEngine", () => {
  describe("generateQuestions", () => {
    it("should generate appropriate questions for coding queries", () => {
      const questions = SocraticEngine.generateQuestions(
        "How do I debug this function?",
        QueryType.CODING,
        SocraticTechnique.ELENCHUS,
      );

      expect(questions).toHaveLength(greaterThan(0));
      expect(questions[0]).toContain("assumption");
    });
  });
});
```

**Integration Tests:**

- Test MCP server request/response cycles
- Verify proper JSON-RPC handling
- Test resource and tool endpoints

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run specific test file
npm test -- --testNamePattern="SocraticEngine"
```

## üìù Documentation Standards

### Code Documentation

**JSDoc Comments:**

````typescript
/**
 * Generates Socratic questions based on query type and technique
 *
 * @param query - The user's input query
 * @param queryType - The categorized type of query
 * @param technique - The Socratic technique to apply
 * @returns Array of thoughtful questions to guide the user
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * const questions = SocraticEngine.generateQuestions(
 *   "How do I fix this bug?",
 *   QueryType.CODING,
 *   SocraticTechnique.ELENCHUS
 * );
 * ```
 */
static generateQuestions(
  query: string,
  queryType: QueryType,
  technique: SocraticTechnique
): string[] {
  // Implementation
}
````

**README Updates:**

- Update README.md when adding new features
- Include usage examples for new functionality
- Document configuration changes
- Keep installation instructions current

### Type Documentation

Document complex types and their usage:

```typescript
/**
 * Represents a user's learning session with progress tracking
 *
 * @interface UserSession
 * @property sessionId - Unique identifier for the session
 * @property queryHistory - Array of past queries with metadata
 * @property preferences - User's learning preferences and settings
 */
export type UserSession = {
  sessionId: string;
  queryHistory: QueryHistoryItem[];
  preferences: UserPreferences;
};
```
