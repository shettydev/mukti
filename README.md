# Mukti

Mukti _(mook-tee /ˈmʊkti/)_, which translates to **Liberation** from the Hindi language.

## Motivation

After the boom of AI, everyone wants to jump on the hypetrain of ChatGPT, or Claude, or Gemini, or Grok, or some other model. Well, who am I to complain, after all, I too am a passenger on this train. But lately I have noticed that people have gotten so dependent and reliant on these models that they are either "in the process of losing" or have "already lost" the ability to think for themselves.

<br />

Now this is a huge problem. Whether you see it or not.

<br />

_Why?_

<br />

Because people in the process are sacrificing their **own thoughts**, **ideas**, **creativity**, **critical thinking**, and even their **own selves**. And this is something I have witnessed firsthand :(

So I have decided to break free from the norms of the world and start my journey towards liberation or **Mukti**.

But this brings me to the next question:

How can we help people regain their ability to think for themselves? And more over, how can you not use AI, which is such an advanced and groundbreaking tool, said to shape the future of mankind and bring us closer to a utopian society?

<br />

MIT conducted a study on ChatGPT users by assigning participants to three groups:

> Turns out, AI isn't making us more productive. It's making us cognitively bankrupt.

## Approach

Simply by using AI.

Weird isn't, makes us go a full circle.

Well my approach towards this problem is to use AI but not rely on it completely. How is that possible? By using it as a companion or as a peer or even better as a **mentor**. Now this way, you are getting the guidance you require by using the platform to bounce of ideas and discover things on your own. I am not saying that you should not use AI, but rather that you should use it as a tool to enhance your own thinking and creativity, and not let it replace your own thoughts and ideas.

Let's take an example to better understand how this works:

---

#### Example 1: Coding Problem

**User**:
“I’m getting a ‘TypeError: NoneType object is not iterable’ in my Python code. What should I do?”

**Mukti**:

- “What part of your code is producing this error?”
- “Have you checked if any of your variables might be set to ‎`None` before this line?”
- “Here’s an article on common Python errors and how to debug them.”
- “What steps have you already tried to fix the issue?”

#### Example 2: Creative Writing

**User**:
"I'm stuck on how to end my short story, which is about a lost traveler."

**Mukti**

- “What emotions do you want your reader to feel at the end?”
- “Have you considered any unexpected twists or resolutions?”
- “Here’s a guide on writing impactful story endings.”
- “Can you summarize the main conflict in your story so far?”

#### Example 3: Personal Productivity

**User**:
“I can’t seem to stay focused while studying. Any advice?”

**Mukti**:

- “What usually distracts you during study sessions?”
- “Have you tried breaking your study time into shorter intervals?”
- “Here’s an article on effective study techniques.”
- “What has worked for you in the past when you needed to concentrate?”
