# Mukti

Mukti (mook-tee /ˈmʊkti/), which translates to liberation from the Hindi language. This is liberation from the world.

## Motivation

After the boom of AI, everyone wants to jump on the hypetrain of ChatGPT, or Claude, or Gemini, or Grok, or some other model. Well, who am I to complain, after all, I too am a passenger on this train. But lately I have noticed that people have gotten so dependent and reliant on these models that they are either "in the process of losing" or have "already lost" the ability to think for themselves.

Now this is a huge problem. Whether you see it or not.

Why?

Because people in the process are sacrificing their own thoughts, ideas, creativity, critical thinking, and even their own selves. And this is something I have witnessed firsthand. So I have decided to break free from the norms of the world and start my journey towards liberation or mukti.

But this brings me to the next question:

How can we help people regain their ability to think for themselves? And more over, how can you not use AI, which is such an advanced and groundbreaking tool, said to shape the future of mankind and bring us closer to a utopian society?
