# Mukti

Mukti _(mook-tee /ˈmʊkti/)_, which translates to **Liberation** from the Hindi language.

## Motivation

After the boom of AI, everyone wants to jump on the hypetrain of ChatGPT, or Claude, or Gemini, or Grok, or some other model. Well, who am I to complain, after all, I too am a passenger on this train. But lately I have noticed that people have gotten so dependent and reliant on these models that they are either "in the process of losing" or have "already lost" the ability to think for themselves.

<br />

Now this is a huge problem. Whether you see it or not.

<br />

_Why?_

<br />

Because people in the process are sacrificing their **own thoughts**, **ideas**, **creativity**, **critical thinking**, and even their **own selves**. And this is something I have witnessed firsthand :(

So I have decided to break free from the norms of the world and start my journey towards liberation or **Mukti**.

But this brings me to the next question:

How can we help people regain their ability to think for themselves? And more over, how can you not use AI, which is such an advanced and groundbreaking tool, said to shape the future of mankind and bring us closer to a utopian society?

<br />

MIT conducted a study on ChatGPT users by assigning participants to three groups:

> Turns out, AI isn't making us more productive. It's making us cognitively bankrupt.

## Approach

Simply by using AI.

Weird isn't, makes us go a full circle.

Well my approach towards this problem is to use AI but not rely on it completely. How is that possible? By using it as a companion or as a peer or even better as a **mentor**. Now this way, you are getting the guidance you require by using the platform to bounce of ideas and discover things on your own. I am not saying that you should not use AI, but rather that you should use it as a tool to enhance your own thinking and creativity, and not let it replace your own thoughts and ideas.

Let's take an example to better understand how this works:

---

#### Example 1: Coding Problem

**User**:
“I’m getting a ‘TypeError: NoneType object is not iterable’ in my Python code. What should I do?”

**Mukti**:

- “What part of your code is producing this error?”
- “Have you checked if any of your variables might be set to ‎`None` before this line?”
- “Here’s an article on common Python errors and how to debug them.”
- “What steps have you already tried to fix the issue?”

#### Example 2: Creative Writing

**User**:
"I'm stuck on how to end my short story, which is about a lost traveler."

**Mukti**

- “What emotions do you want your reader to feel at the end?”
- “Have you considered any unexpected twists or resolutions?”
- “Here’s a guide on writing impactful story endings.”
- “Can you summarize the main conflict in your story so far?”

#### Example 3: Personal Productivity

**User**:
“I can’t seem to stay focused while studying. Any advice?”

**Mukti**:

- “What usually distracts you during study sessions?”
- “Have you tried breaking your study time into shorter intervals?”
- “Here’s an article on effective study techniques.”
- “What has worked for you in the past when you needed to concentrate?”

### Methodology

At the heart of Mukti lies a commitment to empowering users to think for themselves. To achieve this rather than simply providing answers, Mukti employs a socratic approach by engaging users in a dialogue that challenges their assumptions and invites deeper exploration.

"But how on earth would you do this???" you may ask

- **Asking Probing Questions:** Rather than spoon-feeding solutions, Mukti challenges you with clever, thought-provoking questions. It nudges you to dig deeper into your dilemma, consider alternative angles, and really understand the core of the problem.
- **Encouraging Self-Discovery:** Think of Mukti as your intellectual sparring partner. With open-ended prompts, it sparks your curiosity and pushes you to unearth your own insights, making every discovery a personal triumph.
- **Iterative Dialogue:** Conversations with Mukti aren’t one-off Q&As—they’re dynamic journeys. Every question builds on your responses, gently steering you towards clarity while keeping the dialogue lively and engaging.
- **Balancing Guidance with Autonomy:** Mukti walks the fine line between mentorship and independence. With hints here and resourceful nudges there, it fuels your problem-solving drive without ever taking the reins.
- **Cultivating Cognitive Resilience:** By constantly challenging assumptions and fostering a reflective mindset, Mukti isn’t just about quick fixes. It’s about building long-term mental agility, ensuring you're never overly dependent on ready-made answers.

With these Socratic twists, the goal is to transform problem-solving into an adventure—be it specific to coding (debugging, planning, optimization, designing, etc), or any other domain.
